# Neo4j App Builder
## :warning: Prototype only :warning:

## Features
Ideally:
User create their own "package" by selecting what they want to build, what language/framework etc
Then the tool would package it all for the users based on:
https://github.com/msenechal/neo4j-appbuilder
and boilerplates available

## Installation:
```shell
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
